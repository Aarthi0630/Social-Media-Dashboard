# Social Media Dashboard

This is a simple **Social Media Dashboard** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The dashboard allows users to post status updates, view a feed of posts, and delete posts. All posts are saved in `localStorage` so they persist even after refreshing the page.

## Features

- **Post Status Updates:** Users can create a post by entering text and clicking the "Post" button.
- **Display Feed:** The feed section displays all the posts created by the user.
- **Delete Posts:** Each post comes with a "Delete" button that removes the post from the feed.
- **Persistent Data:** Posts are stored in the browser's `localStorage`, so the feed is preserved after refreshing the page.
- **Profile Sidebar:** Displays a basic user profile with some static statistics (e.g., followers, following).
- **Responsive Design:** The layout adjusts for mobile and desktop screens.



## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** To structure the dashboard layout.
- **CSS3:** For styling and making the dashboard responsive.
- **JavaScript:** To handle user interactions, posting status updates, deleting posts, and using `localStorage` for persistence.
